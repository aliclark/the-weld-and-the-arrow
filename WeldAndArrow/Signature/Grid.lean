   Wrinkle 1 — field residue under-determines the agent: internal version

   Outside note this responds to: "Non-typeability is demonstrated by failed
   elaboration, not proved. The internal alternative is to model a universe of
   designations and prove ¬∃ f : FieldFact → Index ... under your axioms."

   The internal route is used here, with the modest scope made explicit.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------- -/

/-- The field-side residue of a weld: everything left once the agent is not
    part of the data. The honest field-fact for recovering an index is
    `Call × Response`, never `Being`. -/
def Grid.fieldOf (w : G.Weld) : G.Call × G.Response := (w.call, w.response)

/-- Naively, "no function `Call × Response → Being` exists" is false whenever
    `Being` is nonempty: a constant function typechecks. What matters is the
    correctness-carrying version, a function claimed to recover, for every
    actual weld, the agent that in fact produced its field residue.

    The theorem below therefore has the honest scope of the claim: no such
    recovery can be correct when two different beings can actually produce the
    same response to the same call. It is not a blanket claim about every
    `Grid`; it is the internal witness that field residues under-determine who
    acted. -/
