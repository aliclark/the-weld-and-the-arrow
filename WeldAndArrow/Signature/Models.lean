   Second concrete display — integer registers with diagnosis-time κ

   The adaptive register clock builds its fine tags as integer-like registers.
   The macro designation is still supplied outside the signature, by a
   `BeingCoarsening`: the model may implement stable internal registers, but
   the standing partition is not stored as "the" being-boundary.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------- -/

/-- A register clock whose fine tags are natural-numbered registers. Each
    register answers the tick by handing off to the next register, and
    delivery follows that hand-off. -/

   Third concrete display — backsliding in one grid

   A single being answers both calls. The gentle call drops to the pole-class;
   the harsh call later carries live share again. Nothing in the grid stores
   the prior drop as an attainment.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------- -/

  Being      := Unit
  Call       := Cue
  Response   := Unit
  respondsTo _ _ := some ()
  grade _ c _ :=
    match c with
    | .gentle => 0
    | .harsh => 5
  conditions _ _ := True

/- --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Fourth concrete display — grading is weld-side, not field-residue side

   The two actual welds share the same call-response residue while receiving
   different shares. The event residue alone therefore cannot carry the grade.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------- -/

inductive GradingCollisionBeing
  | left
  | right

def gradingCollisionGrid : Grid Nat where
  Being      := GradingCollisionBeing
  Call       := Unit

def gradingCollisionRight : gradingCollisionGrid.Weld :=
  ⟨GradingCollisionBeing.right, (), ()⟩

/- `clockGrid` is a genuine, finite, computable term of type `Grid Nat` —
    direct evidence that "a model of the theory" is a buildable Lean
    object, and that facts about a concrete instance are provable at
    `rfl`-level once the instance is fixed. The prudential-privilege
    construction this scaffolding anticipated is carried out in
    `Identification/Ownership.lean`, under
    `Grid.DirectedConvention.PrudentialPrivilegeNegative`: an actual
    `ReceptionPair`, the relevant `Config`/`rePitch` steps, and a named
    `PrudentialPrivilege` recovery proposition are fixed there and the
    proposition is shown to fail. This section checks only that the model
    scaffolding does not get in the way. -/
