   Second concrete display — integer registers with diagnosis-time κ

   The adaptive register clock builds its fine tags as integer-like registers.
   The macro designation is still supplied outside the signature, by a
   `BeingCoarsening`: the model may implement stable internal registers, but
   the standing partition is not stored as "the" being-boundary.

/- `clockGrid` is a genuine, finite, computable term of type `Grid Nat` —
    direct evidence that "a model of the theory" is a buildable Lean
    object, and that facts about a concrete instance are provable at
    `rfl`-level once the instance is fixed. That is the tool a later
    independence result needs: fix a small `Grid`, choose an actual
    `ReceptionPair`, run the relevant `Config`/`rePitch` steps, phrase
    whatever "privilege" would have to assert as a further `Prop` over that
    data, and show it fails in the instance. That construction is not
    carried out here — deciding how to phrase "privilege" formally is itself
    a nontrivial choice belonging to whoever proves the theorem, not to the
    scaffolding. What this section checks is only that the scaffolding does
    not get in the way. -/
