   §4  The separate/fuse rule

   The rule is stated against a deliberately small deep interface. The
   object language itself is abstract: future files choose a concrete
   `Claim` type and a tier-indexed satisfaction relation. What Theory fixes
   is the shape that later work needs: distinctions are pairs of claim
   objects, and recorded utterances carry enough inspectable information for
   a taxonomy generator to ask which call was answered, at which tier the
   utterance was offered, and whether the content is satisfied there.

/-- An abstract object language of claims, together with its tier-indexed
    satisfaction relation. This is intentionally only an interface: later
    files can instantiate `Claim` with the concrete syntax their theorem or
    taxonomy needs, while Theory can already state the separate/fuse rule
    over inspectable claim-objects rather than over anonymous predicates. -/

/-- A recorded utterance, typed as data the taxonomy can inspect. The `weld`
    records who answered which call with which response; this architecturally
    enforces the gradeability rule's positive half, since every utterance the
    taxonomy inspects carries its call. `offeredAt` records the tier at which
    the utterance was made; `content` is a claim-object in the chosen language.
    The proof of `actual` keeps this type for actual recorded utterances rather
    than hypothetical ones. The severed case is handled in
    `Doctrines/Gradeability.lean`. -/
