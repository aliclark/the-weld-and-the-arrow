  WeldAndArrow.Meta.AssumptionLedger
  Canonical assumption prose, checked anchors, and structural checks
================================================================================

The Signature layer keeps the compile-time tripwire for input-side declarations.
This ledger is the canonical source for the reader-facing assumption prose and
for the checked anchor metadata rendered to `Exposition/Assumptions.md`.
