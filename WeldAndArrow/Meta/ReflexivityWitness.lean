  One rung-indexed grid witnessing the ladder over its own labels
================================================================================

Jizang's fourfold two-truths are re-emptied here over their own rung labels.
This is a single legal grid instantiating the opaque `Being` parameter with
`Nat`; it is not a definition of `Being`, and it does not disturb the
boundary-freedom witnessed by `BeingNegative`.
