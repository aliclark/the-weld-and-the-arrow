  The Weld and the Arrow — I. Theory
  A Lean 4 formalization of `paper/Theory.md`
================================================================================

STATUS: checked by `lake build`. The file is intentionally conservative:
mostly term-mode proofs, no Mathlib dependency, and only the small amount of
core Lean needed to keep the theory's primitive signature executable.

No `import`s. The order-theoretic notion is a hand-rolled `Preorder`, not
Mathlib's `Preorder`, to stay dependency-free and make the exact assumptions
visible.

Downstream proof/theorem files should import this module, or the library root
that re-exports it. This file is *only* Theory: the primitive sorts and the
rules, plus a handful of sanity lemmas that check a definition does what the
prose claims of it. Real theorems (backsliding is the one exception — see §2,
it is stated as a theorem already in `Theory.md` itself) belong downstream.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Design log
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* "Nothing self-indexed is stored" is enforced by TYPE DISCIPLINE, not by a
  proved proposition. `Config` (§2) has exactly one field, a `Contrib`-valued
  tendency, and no field of type `Weld` or `Being`-as-owner. That absence is
  not a lemma with a proof term; it is a fact about a `structure` command,
  visible by reading it. This is the positive-direction analogue of the
  paper's internal mis-feed discipline: the elaborator accepts the field
  residue and the stored tendency, but it is never given a stored owner. A
  later weld's share is never a function of any `Config`, because no such
  function exists anywhere in this signature for it to be one of.

* Seeds are field-side. Where the paper speaks of the seeds around a
  being, a "seed" names a standing delivery-line of the web
  (`conditions`), never a potency stored in a being: the ālaya/bīja-as-
  stored-state reading is deliberately not taken. "Potency" names a
  family of such lines incident on a being's candidate receptions —
  relational facts of the web, not carried capacity — so the disposition
  the paper retypes is not readmitted: nothing here is *of* the being.
  The lens is momentary and indexical: successive readings of a tenseless
  web; a great upāya-weld does not *alter* the reading, it is included in
  it — display, not mechanism, nothing travels. And it is descriptive
  only: no comparison, domination, or prescription is defined over it.

* Direction-freedom of `conditions` is a DECISION, not an omission. The
  delivery relation carries no asymmetry, no irreflexivity, and no
  transitivity axioms, and `ReceptionPair` asserts no ordering between its
  two receptions. This is the formal face of the arrow's retype (Theory:
  Karma, "The arrow retyped: direction as display"): the field carries
  correlational structure; before/after is a reading projected into it by
  gradient-embedded beings — the ratchet — never structure. The floor rule
  here eats one more level, as it is licensed to ("the two truths
  themselves are conventional"): act-time, the separate/fuse rule's own
  pivot, is a tier WITHIN the thermodynamic convention. No circle — that
  is precisely the convention beings live in, and why diagnosis happens
  there; floor-fusion accordingly includes fusing before/after. Checked
  counterparts: `Correlated` (§1) and the direction-underdetermination
  countermodel (Invariance). Nothing in any theorem consumes physics:
  thermodynamics enters commentary as the mechanism of the READING, never
  as a premise.

* The `Weld`/`Index` order follows the central modelling choice here:
  `Weld` is primitive (an agent, a call, a response, bundled — nothing else,
  and in particular no separate prior `Act` a
  `Weld` could be said to interpret, since MMK 8 is explicitly "neither
  prior, neither based"), and `index`/`share` are *projections out of* a
  completed `Weld`, never inputs to constructing one. There is no function
  in this file of type `Config _ → Being` or `Call × Response → Being`
  that is asserted total and correct — the one candidate that would be
  (`recover`, in the Preview section) is refuted, not built. That is the
  file's whole enforcement of "self-anchoring": no prior performer, because
  nothing here ever manufactures an index without first being handed a
  complete occurrence to project it from.

* The tier machinery (separate/fuse) exposes the small deep interface
  downstream theorem files will need: a `ClaimLanguage` gives an
  object-language of claims together with tier-indexed satisfaction, a
  `Distinction` stores two claim-objects rather than two bare `Tier → Prop`
  predicates, and a `RecordedUtterance` stores the utterance's weld, offered
  tier, and content. Theory.lean does not choose the concrete language or run
  the taxonomy generator. That remains theorem-level content. The point of
  the interface is only to prevent a shallow encoding from becoming a dead
  end once the fox's sentence, Baizhang's rule, and other recorded utterances
  have to be graded as inspectable objects.

* Every `Contrib`-valued magnitude is kept under a hand-rolled `Preorder` —
  reflexive and transitive, deliberately NOT required to be total. This is
  not a shortcut, it is required by the source text: "some of them, where
  call and self-maintenance interact in the driving, simply incomparable"
  (Theory: Attainment). Mathlib's `Preorder`, notionally the "right" class,
  would have worked identically here; a `LinearOrder` would have silently
  contradicted the paper, which is the reason this file uses its own
  `Preorder` rather than importing whatever the standard library offers.

* The share-zero pole is an order-class (`AtBot`), not literal identity with
  the chosen representative `shareZero`. Equality-to-`shareZero` lemmas are
  kept only as thin bridges into that class; theorem-facing predicates should
  consult the order comparison. This is the formal counterpart of treating
  contribution values as display conventions over a preorder rather than
  operational tokens.

* Kept at plain `Type` throughout rather than universe-polymorphic `Type*`
  because the current examples and intended signatures all live in the first
  universe. Upgrading to universe polymorphism later is routine and touches
  no proofs, only signatures.

   §1  The signature

   `RawWeld` is free-standing (no `Grid` needed to state it) so that `Grid`
   itself can use it in its own field types without a self-reference problem.
   `Grid` bundles everything else: a term of type `Grid Contrib` *is a model
   of the theory* — which is exactly the scaffolding a later countermodel
   (e.g. for prudential privilege, Theorems §1) needs: build one concretely
   and show a property fails in it. A worked instance is built in the Preview
   section to check the scaffolding is actually usable for this, not just
   usable in principle.
============================================================================== -/

/-- An occurrence: a candidate agent, call, and response, bundled. There is
    deliberately no separate `Act` type prior to this — modelling the doer
    as available before the deed would already be the state-tool MMK 8
    forecloses ("neither prior, neither based"). Not every `RawWeld` need
    be `Grid.Actual` (below); the type is closed under hypothetical
    variation on purpose, since the probe (§1, `ProbeConstant`) reasons
    about a *family* of calls a being might face, most of which it never
    actually answers. -/
structure RawWeld (Being Call Response : Type) where
  agent    : Being
  call     : Call
  response : Response

/-- The whole signature, bundled. -/
structure Grid (Contrib : Type) [PreorderBot Contrib] where
  /-- the primitive identity of a causal series (Proofs, disclaimer 4) — a
      tag over a causally-connected run, not a first-personal owner.
      Individuation is not ownership, which is the entire content of
      disclaimer 4; `Being` is exactly as innocent as "chariot" is for
      Siderits. -/
  Being      : Type
  /-- a dharma arriving at Row 2. -/
  Call       : Type
  /-- what a mounted response produces. -/
  Response   : Type
  /-- the dispositional, field-side fact: does this being mount a response
      to this call at all, and which one. `none` for every call is the
      stone (Theory: Attainment, "function-zero, outside the predicate's
      domain") — an `Option`, so that "no response" is not a value of
      `Response` but an absence, undefined rather than a numerically small
      share. -/
  respondsTo : Being → Call → Option Response
  /-- Row 2's reading of a mounted response: what the lens states, an
      abstract point of the display-carrier. No claim is made that this is
      a "component" of anything — the determination itself (what actually
      drove the act) is deliberately not named in the signature. -/
  grade      : Being → Call → Response → Contrib
  /-- delivery: whether an earlier weld's deed conditions a later weld's
      arrival — the field's business, index-free (Theory: Karma, "the
      weld answers only the index-question over what arrives"). Kept
      entirely separate from `respondsTo`/`grade`, which are about
      *drive*, never about *delivery*: conflating the two is a taxonomy
      error in its own right (Theorems, Grade 1, "Delivery-question /
      index-question"). Note also the axioms this field does NOT carry:
      no asymmetry, no irreflexivity, no transitivity. The "earlier"/
      "later" above is gloss, not structure — the relation as typed is
      direction-free, and its symmetric closure (`Correlated`, below)
      provably under-determines it (Invariance: the direction-
      underdetermination witness). Like the absent `PreorderTop`, the
      absence is a decision (Theory: Karma, "the arrow retyped"). -/

   §2  What is carried, what is made, what is stated

   The load-bearing invariant of the whole system — "nothing self-indexed
   is stored" — is enforced by what `Config` does NOT contain, not by a
   proposition about what it contains. `Config` carries exactly one thing:
   a `Contrib`-valued tendency (the seed), a field-fact about the series.
   There is no field of type `Weld`, and — just as importantly — nothing
   below ever defines a function FROM `Config` back INTO a `grade`
   reading: the causal machinery that actually determines a later weld's
   share (`Grid.grade`) never once takes a `Config` as input. That
   disconnection is deliberate and is the architectural content of the
   retyped disposition/act cell (Theory: Attainment, "the collapse is
   inferential — the dated occurrence read off the standing tendency"):
   there is no function in this signature for a later act's share to be
   read off a standing tendency THROUGH, so the error the retype names is
   not merely discouraged here, it is inexpressible.
============================================================================== -/

/-- What the field carries between acts: a tendency to arrogate, and
    nothing else. This *is* the formalization of "nothing self-indexed is
    stored" — not a theorem about `Config`, but `Config`'s definition, read
    by what is and is not present in the type. There is deliberately no
    association from `Config` to `Being` anywhere in the signature:
    possessive readings ("this being's configuration") are downstream
    glosses, never structure. -/

/-- Reception re-pitches the configuration the field carries forward — an

    of "unconstrained by construction" (Theory: Karma, "one magnitude is
    deliberately unconstrained... owned here as a feature") — not the
    only possible one, but a simple one, and it already allows arbitrarily
    large jumps between successive configs (Theorems: "Sudden and

/- Design note — no share-from-Config route exists.
   The determination of a later weld's share never consults any `Config`:
   there is no function `Config Contrib → Contrib` anywhere in `Grid`'s
   signature for a later act to be constrained by.
   This is exhibited by the shape of the signature, not provable as a
   single theorem of it (any candidate statement collapses to `share`'s
   own definition with unused binders — an earlier draft's
   `share_independent_of_config` did exactly that and was removed). The
   architectural content lives in §2's `Config` note: the file stores no
   self-indexed attainment for a later act to be held to. -/

    which end is "earlier" is a reading. The countermodel in Invariance
    shows the reading is genuinely extra — two grids can agree on
    `Correlated` everywhere and disagree on `conditions` — so direction

   The environs lens

   A descriptive, momentary reading of the web around a being: which
   standing delivery-lines are incident on its candidate receptions, and
   which of those would, against a supplied prior tendency, be
   share-ceding. Everything here is a projection from `conditions` and
   `IsShareDrop`; nothing is stored in, or of, the being.

   Deliberately NOT operationalized: no comparison relation, no domination
   order, no measure, no prescription. The lens says only, coarsely, what
   stands around a being at a moment. Errors about the reading — attaching
   to it, ranking beings by it — are for other beings to make or not, as
   with the grid itself.

   §3  Row 1 and Row 3, briefly

   "All acting is Row 3" (Theory: the act-grammar): Row 3 (shu) is not a
   further reading that needs its own type, it IS `Weld` — there is no
   separate act underneath the weld for shu to be a fact about. Likewise
   Row 1 (genjō) at the grain of a single act is not a further condition,
   it is the weld under its enactment-reading, and every weld satisfies it
   trivially — which is why no `def` for either appears here: manufacturing
   a nontrivial predicate for "this act manifests, full stop" or "this act
   is practice" would be adding content the source explicitly declines to
   add ("its three cells are the three parts of one sentence ... not three
   agents"). The one Row-1 usage with real content is the DERIVED,
   narrower sense — the grade's share-zero pole — and that one already has
   a definition: `Grid.AtZeroSharePole` in §1. Row 2 (kannō-sōe,
   the grade) is the only row this file gives independent definitional
   content to, via `Grid.share`, which is exactly the source's own claim:
   "Row 2 still does exactly one thing, the adverb."

   §4  The separate/fuse rule

   The rule is stated against a deliberately small deep interface. The
   object language itself is abstract: future files choose a concrete
   `Claim` type and a tier-indexed satisfaction relation. What Theory fixes
   is the shape that later work needs: distinctions are pairs of claim
   objects, and recorded utterances carry enough inspectable information for
   a taxonomy generator to ask which call was answered, at which tier the
   utterance was offered, and whether the content is satisfied there.

   Wrinkle 1 — field residue under-determines the agent: internal version

   Outside note this responds to: "Non-typeability is demonstrated by failed
   elaboration, not proved. The internal alternative is to model a universe of
   designations and prove ¬∃ f : FieldFact → Index ... under your axioms."

   The internal route is used here, with the modest scope made explicit.

/-- The field-side residue of a weld: everything left once the agent is not

    `Call × Response`, never `Being`. -/
def Grid.fieldOf (w : G.Weld) : G.Call × G.Response := (w.call, w.response)

/-- Naively, "no function `Call × Response → Being` exists" is false whenever
    `Being` is nonempty: a constant function typechecks. What matters is the
    correctness-carrying version, a function claimed to recover, for every
    actual weld, the agent that in fact produced its field residue.

    The theorem below therefore has the honest scope of the claim: no such
    recovery can be correct when two different beings can actually produce the
    same response to the same call. It is not a blanket claim about every
    `Grid`; it is the internal witness that field residues under-determine who
    acted. -/

   Wrinkle 2 — underivability claims need countermodels: scaffold checked

   Outside note this responds to: "Underivability claims need
   countermodels. 'Prudential privilege is underivable' is a non-
   derivability result — you'd exhibit a model satisfying the axioms
   where the privilege fails."

   Prudential privilege itself is theorem-level content. This file supplies
   the neutral carrier it will need (`ActualWeld`/`ReceptionPair`) but does
   not formulate the privilege predicate or prove its failure.
   What is checked here is narrower and prior: that "a model of the theory"
   is not just a phrase but a term one can actually build and compute with,
   because that is the one thing a later countermodel construction cannot
   do without. `clockGrid` below is also, independently, the worked example
   `Theory.md` itself gives for the domain joint (Theory: Attainment,
   "The domain joint" — the manufactured cuckoo clock), so it is in scope
   for this file on its own terms, not only as a preview.

    whatever "privilege" would have to assert as a further `Prop` over that
    data, and show it fails in the instance. That construction is not
    carried out here — deciding how to phrase "privilege" formally is itself
    a nontrivial choice belonging to whoever proves the theorem, not to the
    scaffolding. What this section checks is only that the scaffolding does
    not get in the way. -/
