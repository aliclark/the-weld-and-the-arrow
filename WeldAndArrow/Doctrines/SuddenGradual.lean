  Sudden and gradual arrivals as thin readings over re-pitch machinery
================================================================================

The doctrine-facing vocabulary here names shapes already permitted by the
signature: one received weld can arrive at the pole, and a finite run can do so
in stages. No rate preference or stored altitude is added.
