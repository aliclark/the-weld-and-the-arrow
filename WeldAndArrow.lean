/-!
Root module for the `WeldAndArrow` library.

Layers:
* `Signature`: definitions and primitive interfaces.
* `Consequences`: neutral lemma library, including the error taxonomy.
* `Doctrines`: discourse-facing checked conditionals with sibling negatives.
* `Identification`: the naming claim, ownership vocabulary, placements,
  disclaimers, commentary, and placement-gating results.
* `Meta`: invariance discipline, sibling countermodels, and audit.

Placement rules:
1. Place a declaration by the vocabulary its statement consumes.
2. Put negative witnesses in the sibling module of the claim they gate.
3. Preserve the layer DAG: Signature -> Consequences -> Doctrines ->
   Identification -> Meta.
